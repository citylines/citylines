Development
===========

This repo contains the client and the API, which are built with the following technologies:
- Client: ReactJS + Mapbox GL's data-driven magic.
- API: Sinatra + Postgres/Postgis

In order to setup the development enviroment (we use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)), the following steps are required.

Docker
------
Install Docker and docker-compose

Mapbox
------
- Create an account in Mapbox, and a base style
- Copy `/api/config/mapbox.yml.sample` to `/api/config/mapbox.yml` and fill the `access_token` and the `style` attributes

Google Auth
-----------
- Get a `google_client_id` for the Google Login from the Google console
- Copy `/api/config/auth.yml.sample` to `/api/config/auth.yml` and set the attributes. The `secret` should be a secret random string

Build!
------

```
docker-compose up --build
```

This command also runs migrations and builds the frontend (`rake db:migrate`, `yarn install` and `yarn build`).

Go to localhost:8080 and you should have Citylines running in your machine.

Other tasks
-------

- Import a dump
```
docker exec citylines_db_1 pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -U citylines -d citylines <DUMP_PATH>
```

- Connect to the local console
```
docker exec -it citylines_web_1 bundle exec rake console
```

- Re-build the frontend
```
docker exec citylines_web_1 yarn build
```
